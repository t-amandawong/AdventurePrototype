A simple adventure game by Thanyared Wong based on a simple adventure game engine by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly).

Code requirements:
- **4+ scenes based on `AdventureScene`**: Bedroom, Hallway, Garden, Pond.
- **2+ scenes *not* based on `AdventureScene`**: Intro, Outro.
- **2+ methods or other enhancement added to the adventure game engine to simplify my scenes**:
    - Enhancement 1: describe() method: adds a pointerover and pointerdown message for an object.
    - Enhancement 2: takeAndDescribe() method: adds a pointerover and two pointerdown messages for before and after an item is added to your inventory.

Experience requirements:
- **4+ locations in the game world**: Bedroom, Hallway, Garden, Pond.
- **2+ interactive objects in most scenes**: all scenes have at least 2 interactive objects (example: 'pen cup' in Bedroom scene and 'door' in the Hallway scene.)
- **Many objects have `pointerover` messages**: all objects have pointerover messages.
- **Many objects have `pointerdown` effects**: all objects have pointerdown messages.
- **Some objects are themselves animated**: 'mouse' in Bedroom scene plays an animation, and the 'rabbit' in the Garden scene also has an animation.

Asset sources:
All assets were made by me in Adobe Illustrator.
